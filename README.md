# Spotify-Classifier

This project attempts to sort songs into different Spotify playlists based off of listener attributes, such as Liveness, Acousticness, Energy etc. The data was pulled directly from Spotify using the `spotipy` package and developer tool on
Python. The project includes reading the data, wrangling it, and creating a Decision Tree classification model using `scikit-learn`. The repository also contains two `.pdf` images, which are off decision trees built in the project. In this
project, we also analyzed the effetiveness of such a classification technique, and how our model could be improved.
